# iter-quant-model — Progress tracker (resumable)

**Purpose of this file:** `PLAN.md` (written by Fable 5) is the durable spec — read it first, it does not
change as work lands. This file is the **live state**: what's actually done, what's in flight, what
deviated from plan and why, and exactly where to resume. Any agent (OpenCode/DeepSeek/Claude) picking up
this iteration cold should read `PLAN.md` §0-2 for context, then this file for current state, then jump
to "Resume here".

**Branch:** `iter/quant-model` (based on `iter/data-mgmt` @ `f9b53f7`).
**Convention:** one phase/subphase = one commit, gate output pasted into the commit body (per PLAN.md §6).
Do not batch multiple subphases into one commit — the next agent needs to bisect cleanly.

## Resume here

→ **P4.5.4 (wire calibrations) is next — P4.5.2, P4.5.3, and P4.5.1 are DONE.** Three of the seven P4.5
sub-fixes have landed: Exit Lab JSON format mismatch (P4.5.2), ExitReplayer venue divergences (P4.5.3), and
walk-forward test leg + PlateauPicker (P4.5.1). The remaining four — calibrations wiring (P4.5.4), P(pass)
surfaces (P4.5.5), scoreboard (P4.5.6), and cleanup items (P4.5.7) — are still outstanding.
1. **[CRITICAL] Walk-forward never runs the test window** — `WalkForwardBackgroundService` sweeps TRAIN,
   then records the best train cell's numbers AS the `Test*` results; `testFrom/testTo` are stored and never
   executed. The "stitched OOS equity curve" is stitched in-sample maxima. `PickPlateauCell` is
   `MaxBy(NetProfit + WinRate×1000)` — not a plateau pick, no tiebreak (both banned by PLAN §6 P4.2).
2. **[CRITICAL] Exit Lab dead end-to-end** — recorder serializes `[{"t","hi","lo"},...]` (objects);
   `ExitLabController.ParsePoints` parses `List<List<double>>` (arrays) → exception swallowed → every trade
   silently skipped → `/api/exit-lab/evaluate` can only return 0 trades/0 cells. (Trade-detail UI parses the
   object shape fine — the controller is the odd one out.)
3. **[CRITICAL] ExitReplayer diverges from the venue** — short-side spread ignored (`SpreadPips` dead),
   BE/trail updated per M1 point vs venue's per-DECISION-bar cadence, MAE comparison inverted (MAE output
   garbage, zero tests assert it), partial-TP params accepted but never enter the R math. Root cause: the
   P3.3 validation gate ("replayer reproduces a real run's exits") was deferred — land it first.
4. **[HIGH] Saved calibrations cannot affect any run** — `SlAtrMultiple`/`TpRrMultiple` consumed by nothing,
   no path sets `Mode=Calibrated`, and the UI's free-text TF ("h1") never matches the lookup's
   `Timeframe.ToString()` ("H1").
5. **[HIGH] P(pass) surfaces answer wrong questions** — exit-lab feeds sorted per-trade Rs as DAILY PnL with
   `DaysRemaining = 30 − tradeCount`; run-detail clamps to 1 day remaining for any long completed run.
6. **[HIGH] Scoreboard is in-sample vibes** — latest-run avgR (exploration/sweep-train runs included), cell
   trades not filtered by symbol/TF, and the P4.4 traffic-light formula is off ~30× vs QUANT-ROADMAP §3.3
   (`ln(0.05)/ln(1−r·avgR)` ≈ 1,996 trades where `target%/(risk%×avgR)` ≈ 67), with NaN defaulting to GREEN.

Full traces, fixes, failing-test-first specs, and execution order: **PLAN.md §3 P4.5** (+ §9 addendum:
evidence workflow, per-phase direction for P5–P7). Pattern for the record: every phase that shipped with a
deferred validation gate produced a critical bug (P1→P1.5.1, P3.3→items 2-3, P4→item 1). A deferred gate
now means the phase is NOT done.

**After P4.5:** P5 — Data + triage (owner-driven): download 7 symbols × {M1,M15,H1,H4}, non-FX correctness
tests, exploration triage, portfolio assembly. See PLAN.md §3 P5 + §9.3 direction.

**cTrader test triage (owner request, 2026-07-05):** policy written at `docs/CTRADER-TEST-POLICY.md` —
keep-set (connection/round-trip/ledger-reconcile/data-acquisition) gets `Category=CtraderContract`; the
"produces trades over N days" behavior tests retire to tape equivalents. Implementing that triage is a
one-commit task; do it alongside or right after P4.5.

P1.5.4 (MISSING_DATA verdict) stays folded into P2's verdict-funnel work per the original triage (still
not done — P4/scoreboard-adjacent, not blocking anything so far).

**Gate filter note (owner request, 2026-07-05, UPDATED same day):** cTrader-backed E2E tests
(`Category=E2E`, `Category=Slow`, `Category=NetMQ`, `RequiresCTrader=true`) are slow/flaky in this sandbox
even though credentials ARE present (confirmed — they actually run for real, not skip) and cost 10-25+
minutes per run under contention — and have been a recurring blocker/flake source across sessions. Gate
every phase with:
`dotnet test tests/TradingEngine.Tests.Simulation --filter "RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ"`
instead of the full Simulation suite. **The full cTrader-inclusive suite is deferred to the END OF P3 (not
P2)** — the owner overrode the original "once at the end of P2" plan mid-session. Note that P2's own
full-suite box is EFFECTIVELY ALREADY CHECKED: that run (started once, mid-session, per the original plan)
caught a real regression before the owner's override landed — the `CTraderBrokerAdapter` `isLimit`
derivation bug, root-caused and fixed in P2.7's second commit (see P2.7's write-up below) — so P2's
cTrader-inclusive gate did its job once, just not to full completion. The deferred full run at the end of
P3 should cover P3's OWN changes (the excursion recorder, and whatever P3.2+ adds), not re-litigate P2.
Do not attempt the full/cTrader-inclusive run again until P3 is complete, and even then only if explicitly
asked.

This branch: 5 commits on top of `iter/quant-model` (9b9dbfc):
- `edeb3a6` P1.1 — instance-per-row, de-hardcoded H1 in all 14 strategies
- `e376a1b` P1.2 — EntryTimeframe on OrderProposed for per-TF analytics
- `71ea2d7` P1.3 — aux-TF bar preloading for mtf-trend (fixes silent death on tape)
- `6d41398` P1.4 — HonestFills checkbox on new-backtest form
- (P1.5 commit — indicator-timeframe fix + aux-TF point-in-time cursor + fail-loud TF parse)

### Static-review findings (2026-07-05) — see PLAN.md P1.5 for full detail, traced via code + call-site grep, not guesses
1. **[CRITICAL, CONFIRMED] Indicator requests are still pinned to H1.** `IndicatorRequest`'s `Timeframe`
   parameter defaults to H1, and none of the 9 strategies' `RequiredIndicators` pass
   `Timeframe: _config.EntryTimeframe` (mtf-trend hardcodes it explicitly for RSI/ATR). Effect: any run-plan
   row with `EntryTimeframe != H1` never gets its indicators computed (the TF's bars were never loaded) →
   every strategy silently returns null on any non-H1 timeframe — the exact "0 trades on M15" bug P1 exists to
   fix, moved one layer down. Not caught because the M15 acceptance test was skipped (see below) and the one
   test added this session (`IndicatorCacheKeyTests`) only tests `BuildKey` in isolation with hand-picked
   distinct-TF requests, never what the real strategies pass.
2. **[CRITICAL, CONFIRMED] Aux-TF preload leaks future data (lookahead bias).** `EngineRunner.cs`'s P1.3 code
   loads mtf-trend's ENTIRE run H4 bar range up front and computes `EMA_200` exactly ONCE before the loop
   starts — that single, run-end-inclusive value is then read for every decision throughout the whole
   backtest. Contradicts PLAN.md's own P1.3 design (aux bars should be gated by `closeTime <= decision bar
   closeTime`); the shipped code has no such gating. Affects mtf-trend at ANY EntryTimeframe (independent of
   finding 1). No existing/future mtf-trend tape result should be trusted for calibration until fixed.
3. **[LOW, CONFIRMED] Silent H1 fallback on unparseable run-plan TF string** in
   `StrategyRegistry.CreateStrategies` (`Enum.TryParse(...) ? tf : Timeframe.H1`) — unreachable today (UI
   always sends valid values) but a landmine of the exact bug class this iteration exists to kill. Should
   throw, not silently default.
4. **[LOW, documentation gap] MISSING_DATA verdict was never implemented** — PLAN.md's P1.3 gate promised it;
   grep of `src/`+`tests/` for `MISSING_DATA` returns zero hits, and it wasn't disclosed in the deviations list
   below. Deferred to P2's verdict-funnel work (unchanged — not part of the P1.5 fix below).

### P1.5 fixes — Done (2026-07-05, same session as the review)

All three findings above independently re-verified by direct code trace (not just re-reading the review)
before fixing, and each has a failing-test-first regression test confirmed to fail against the pre-fix code:

- **P1.5.1** — every strategy's `RequiredIndicators` now passes `Timeframe: _config.EntryTimeframe`
  (mtf-trend: RSI/ATR only; EMA keeps `_config.HigherTimeframe`). New tests:
  `StrategyIndicatorTimeframeTests` (per-strategy, all 9) + `NonH1AcceptanceTests` (real
  `BarEvaluator`+`IndicatorSnapshotService`-driven M15 tape run, ≥1 trend-breakout proposal — the literal
  P1.2 gate the plan asked for and P1 skipped). Found and fixed an unrelated pre-existing gap while writing
  the acceptance test: `StrategyTestHelper.MakeContext` hardcodes bars under the `Timeframe.H1` key
  regardless of the actual bar's TF — a test-helper limitation, not a production bug; left as-is since
  `NonH1AcceptanceTests` doesn't use that helper.
- **P1.5.2** — `IndicatorSnapshotService` gained `SetAuxBarSource`/`AdvanceAuxBarsAsync`: the full aux-TF
  range is registered but held back in a cursor, revealed one bar at a time gated by
  `auxBar.OpenTimeUtc + tf.ToTimeSpan() <= decisionBarCloseUtc`, recomputing that aux TF's indicators only
  when new bars actually became eligible. `BarEvaluator.EvaluateAsync` calls `AdvanceAuxBarsAsync` before
  `RecomputeIndicatorsAsync` each decision bar. `EngineRunner.RunAsync`'s old bulk-load-and-recompute-once
  block replaced with a `SetAuxBarSource` registration call. New test `AuxTfLookaheadTests` (real
  `BarEvaluator` pipeline, synthetic H4 series with a step-change midway) — confirmed to fail
  (`Observed` stayed empty) with the `AdvanceAuxBarsAsync` call temporarily commented out, confirmed to pass
  restored.
- **P1.5.3** — `StrategyRegistry.CreateStrategies`'s run-plan branch now throws `InvalidOperationException`
  on an unparseable TF string instead of silently binding H1. New tests: `StrategyRegistryTests` (throws on
  `"bogus"`, binds correctly on `"M15"`).

Gate: `dotnet build` 0 errors; Unit 356/0/6 (skips pre-existing, up from 347 — +9 new); Integration 94/0;
fast Simulation (`RequiresCTrader!=true`, includes golden/determinism) 124/0 (4m30s, byte-identical — expected,
since the fix only changes behavior for non-H1 runs and mtf-trend's aux path, neither exercised by the
existing H1-only golden fixtures); Architecture 6/8 (2 pre-existing failures, same as documented in the P0.1
section above — `EngineReducer.cs:436` and `VenueSessionEntity`, neither file touched this session).

### What's NOT in P1 (deferred, by design — distinct from the bugs above)
- Warning chip for "strategy TF has no inventory data" — the infrastructure exists (inventory in Data Manager) but the per-row warning chip wasn't added to new-backtest. This is genuinely P2 scope (when scoreboard/triage make it matter).
- Verdict funnel counters in run monitor — `StrategyVerdict` records carry the data, endpoint exists, but the UI widget wasn't built. P2 scope.
- Per-row instance dedup — `CreateStrategies` creates one instance per (strategy, symbol, TF) row. Duplicate rows create duplicate instances. Harmless (each evaluates independently) but wasteful. Fix if it shows up in perf profiling.

## P0.1 — R vs initial stop — **Done**

**Commit:** `fix(P0.1): compute R-multiple against initial stop, not trailed stop` (this branch).

### What shipped
- `PositionState.InitialStopLoss` (new field, set once in `PositionLifecycle.CreateIntended`, never
  mutated by any `with` expression elsewhere — verified by grep, no other site touches it).
- `PublishTradeClosed.InitialStopLoss` carries it through all 4 construction sites in
  `PositionLifecycle.cs` (partial-close, open→closed, reducing→closed, closing→closed — there are
  **4** sites, not the 3 the plan's agent-guidance section guessed; all 4 live in `PositionLifecycle.cs`,
  none in `EngineReducer.cs`).
- `EffectExecutor.HandlePublishTradeClosed` computes `riskDistance` from `effect.InitialStopLoss`
  instead of `effect.StopLoss` (which is the current/trailed stop at close time — unchanged meaning,
  still used for display).
- `TradeResult.InitialStopLoss` (nullable `Price?`) + `TradeResultEntity.InitialStopLoss` (nullable
  `decimal?`) + EF migration `M34_InitialStopLoss` (nullable, old rows unaffected).
- `EntrySnapshotJson` now correctly stores the INITIAL stop (`effect.InitialStopLoss.Value`) — see
  deviation note below, this was silently storing the final/trailed stop before.
- `ExitDetailJson` gains `finalStopLoss` + `initialStopLoss` keys alongside the existing `reason`/`exit`/`r`.
- Backfill: `POST /api/system/backfill-initial-stop` on `SystemController` (idempotent — only touches
  rows where `InitialStopLoss IS NULL`; safe to re-run). Takes a file-copy DB backup first
  (`trading.bak-{timestamp}.db` next to the live db) before writing anything.

### Deviation from PLAN.md — why, and what to tell the owner
Plan text (§P0.1): *"Backfill script (D2): parse `EntrySnapshotJson.stopLoss`, recompute `RMultiple` in
place."* **This source is wrong for exactly the trades the bug corrupted most.**

Traced it in code: `EntrySnapshotJson` (despite its name) is built at **close** time in
`EffectExecutor.HandlePublishTradeClosed` from `effect.StopLoss` — which is `PositionState.CurrentStopLoss`
at the moment of close, i.e. the **final/trailed** stop, not the entry-time stop. For a trade that never
had breakeven/trailing trigger before closing, current==initial, so the plan's recipe happens to work. For
a trade where BE/trailing DID move the stop (exactly the TP-exit population the plan's own §0.3 flags —
"TP exits average R=6.997" — because a TP exit usually means price ran deep enough to trigger BE/trail
first), `EntrySnapshotJson.stopLoss` is the WRONG (moved) value. Backfilling from it would reproduce the
same bug under a different name.

**What the backfill actually uses instead:** the persisted `Journal` table (table name is `Journal`, not
`JournalEntries` as the DbSet property name and some comments imply — checked the live schema directly).
Every accepted entry has an `OrderProposed` journal row (`EventKind='OrderProposed'`, `DecisionReason=
'Accepted'`) whose `EventJson` carries the strategy's original `StopLoss` at the top level, keyed by
`OrderId`. Verified against the live DB: **100% of the 1,467 existing trades have a matching
`OrderProposed` row** for their `RunId`/`OrderId` (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TradeResults t WHERE NOT EXISTS
(SELECT 1 FROM Journal j WHERE j.RunId=t.RunId AND j.EventKind='OrderProposed')` → 0). Backfill logic:
group candidate trades by `RunId`, pull that run's `OrderProposed` rows once, build an `OrderId → StopLoss`
map, apply. Falls back to `EntrySnapshotJson.stopLoss` only if a run has no journal (pre-journal-era data,
none currently in the live DB) — that fallback path is flagged `"approx": true` in the response so nobody
mistakes it for the accurate figure.

This is a strictly more-correct implementation of the same intent (honest R), not a scope change — flagging
it here because the next agent (or the owner) reading PLAN.md literally would reach for the wrong column.

### Gate evidence
- New tests: `PipCalculatorTests` (4 new, pure R-multiple math incl. the regression case showing a
  breakeven-moved stop must NOT change R), `PositionLifecycleTests` (2 new: `CreateIntended` sets
  `InitialStopLoss`; a full close after a simulated `CurrentStopLoss` move still publishes the ORIGINAL
  stop), `InitialStopBackfillerTests` (6 new, pure parser/resolver — journal-shape JSON confirmed against
  the live DB, malformed-row handling, journal-preferred-over-snapshot-fallback).
- `dotnet build` (full solution): 0 errors.
- Unit: 326 passed, 6 skipped (pre-existing skips), 0 failed.
- Integration: 94 passed, 0 failed (required generating+applying the EF migration first — WebSmokeTests
  boots the real app and EF's `PendingModelChangesWarning` correctly caught the un-migrated model).
- Fast Simulation suite (`RequiresCTrader!=true`, includes golden/determinism): **120 passed, 0 failed —
  byte-identical, no re-baseline needed** (R lives on `TradeResult`, not `StepRecord`, exactly as the plan
  predicted).
- Architecture suite: 6 passed, 2 failed — both **pre-existing on this branch, not introduced by P0.1**
  (`EngineReducer.cs:436` `DateTime.UtcNow` in `ReconcileToVenue`, and `VenueSessionEntity` missing
  `IAuditableEntity` — neither file was touched this session; confirmed via `git diff` showing no changes
  to either, and `EngineReducer.cs` last modified 2026-07-01, three days before this session).
- **Backfill dry-run**, run twice against an isolated copy of the live db (never touched the real
  `trading.db` — copied to scratchpad, ran the Web app against the copy via `Persistence__DbPath`, called
  the endpoint, deleted the copy after):
  - First call: `totalCandidates: 1467, updatedFromJournal: 1467, updatedFromSnapshotFallback: 0,
    skippedNoSource: 0` — every existing trade resolved from the journal, none needed the fallback.
  - Second call (idempotency check): `totalCandidates: 0` — correctly a no-op on rerun.
  - **Before/after the actual bug**, queried by `ExitReason` for `trend-breakout` (the strategy the plan's
    §0.3 cited): TP-exit average R was **6.997** in the plan's original evidence (computed against the
    trailed stop); after backfill + the forward fix, TP-exit average R on the same data is **1.938** across
    236 TP trades — matching the strategy's configured 2.0-3.0 RR instead of the inflated figure. SL-exit
    average moved from the plan's −0.68 to −0.599 (942 trades). This is the concrete before/after the plan's
    gate asked for.
- **The live `trading.db` was NOT touched.** The endpoint (`POST /api/system/backfill-initial-stop`) is
  implemented, tested against an isolated copy, and ready — running it for real against the owner's live
  data is a one-command call but is exactly the kind of data-mutating action worth the owner's go-ahead
  first, even though it's idempotent and self-backing-up.

---

## P0.2 — Full-spread convention (D3) — **Done**

**Commit:** `fix(P0.2): full-spread convention, both replay venues` (this branch).

### What shipped
- New `src/TradingEngine.Infrastructure/Adapters/SpreadConvention.cs` — the single shared helper
  (`AskPrice(bid, spread)`, `AskBar(bidBar, spread)`) used by both `TapeReplayAdapter` and
  `BacktestReplayAdapter`, replacing each adapter's own `GetHalfSpread()` (spread/2) with `GetSpread()`
  (full spread) and routing every fill/detection site through the shared helper — this is what makes the
  two adapters unable to drift apart again (that drift is exactly how the pre-existing half-spread bug
  happened, independently, in both files).
- Fixed 8 call sites per adapter (16 total): long market entry (half→full spread), buy-limit reached
  condition (was missing spread entirely — `bar.Low <= limit`, now `bar.Low + spread <= limit`), sell-limit
  reached condition (had a spurious half-spread — now correctly raw `bar.High >= limit`), short SL/TP
  detection bar shift (half→full), short SL/TP fill price (half→full), `ClosePositionAsync` (long lost its
  incorrect half-spread subtraction entirely — selling at bid is the raw price, no adjustment; short
  half→full), `ComputeFloatingPnL` (same long/short correction), and the tick-channel synthetic ask (was
  `close + PipSize` — ONE PIP regardless of the symbol's actual spread, completely unrelated to the fill
  spread; now `close + GetSpread()`, the same source as fills).
- Long-side SL/TP detection and fill price were ALREADY correct (raw, unshifted) before this change — only
  the short side and the two bugs above (missing/spurious limit-spread, mismatched tick spread) needed
  fixing.

### Gate evidence
- **Table-driven fill-path tests, written first, confirmed failing pre-fix**: 8 cases × 2 adapters = 16
  tests (`BacktestReplaySpreadConventionTests.cs`, `TapeReplaySpreadConventionTests.cs`), 2-pip spread,
  hand-computed literal fill prices per the plan's own prescription. Pre-fix run: 3/8 failed per adapter
  (long entry, short SL, short TP) with the failing diffs showing exactly half the expected spread
  (off by 0.0001 against an 0.0002 spread) — direct evidence of the bug. Post-fix: 16/16 green.
- Unit: 342 passed (up from 326), 6 skipped, 0 failed.
- Integration: 94/94 passed.
- Fast Simulation suite (golden/determinism, `RequiresCTrader!=true`): **120 passed, 0 failed — byte-
  identical, confirmed after the run completed** (4m15s).
- **No separate REBASELINE commit was needed.** The plan expected characterization baselines to move; they
  didn't, because the existing golden/characterization fixtures don't happen to exercise the specific
  half-spread-affected paths (long entry, short SL/TP fill price, limit-reached conditions) — they're
  long-side-heavy fixtures or rely on `ClosePositionAtAsync`/engine-detected exit prices that were already
  correct pre-fix. This was verified, not assumed (per the plan's own rule: if golden had moved, stop and
  investigate before re-baselining — it didn't move, so there's nothing to investigate). A future run with
  short-heavy or limit-heavy fixtures WOULD show a P&L delta; nothing in the current suite happens to cross
  that path.

## P0.3 — Honest entry timing (D4, tape only) — **Done**

**Commit:** `fix(P0.3): honest entry timing — market fills at next fine bar's open` (this branch).

### What shipped
- `TapeReplayAdapter`: new `_pendingMarketOrders` dictionary (mirrors `_pendingLimits` exactly). When
  `HonestFills` is on (default) AND finer (M1) exit bars exist (`_exitBars.Count > 0`), a market order
  queues in `SubmitOrderAsync` instead of filling instantly; `ProcessPendingMarketOrders(fine)` — called
  first in the fine-bar loop inside `OnBarObserved`, before `ProcessPendingLimits`/`ProcessSlTpHits` so a
  freshly-filled position's SL/TP still gets checked against the SAME bar it entered on (correct intrabar
  behaviour) — fills each pending order at that fine bar's `Open` (± full spread via `SpreadConvention`,
  same directional convention as every other fill path).
- `HonestFills` constructor param (default `true`) read ONCE at construction, not branched per-bar (plan's
  own trap warning). Wired through `BacktestOrchestrator.cs` via `cfg.CustomParams["HonestFills"]`, same
  pattern as the existing `GovernorEnabled`/`DisableRegime` toggles — `!= "false"` defaults it ON.
- Flush trap (plan's own warning, hit exactly as predicted while writing the disconnect test): an order
  queued on the last fine bar of the run has no more bars to fill it — `FlushPendingMarketOrders()` fills
  any still-pending orders at `_lastClose` (± spread) inside `DisconnectAsync`, before the channels
  complete. `DisposeAsync` clears (doesn't fill) any survivors, matching the existing precedent for
  `_pendingLimits` (dispose is a hard stop, disconnect is the graceful flush point).
- When no finer data exists (`_exitBars.Count == 0` — single-resolution mode, or `HonestFills=false`),
  behavior is BYTE-IDENTICAL to before: instant fill at the decision bar's close. `BacktestReplayAdapter`
  is untouched — P0.3 is tape-only per the plan (`BacktestReplayAdapter` has no finer-than-decision-TF
  bars to honestly queue against).

### Known gap (intentionally out of scope here)
`HonestFills` is only settable via `BacktestConfig.CustomParams` at the engine/orchestrator layer — there
is no REST request DTO field or Angular UI checkbox yet. Adding one is P1.4-shaped work (UI guardrails);
P0 stayed scoped to engine correctness. The next agent touching the new-backtest UI should wire it then.

### Gate evidence
- 5 new unit tests (`TapeReplayHonestFillsTests.cs`): queues instead of filling at submit; fills at the
  next fine bar's open with the correct directional spread (long +spread, short raw); `HonestFills=false`
  preserves the exact old instant-fill behavior (A/B, both paths asserted against the same fixture);
  a pending order on the last bar of the run still fills at `DisconnectAsync` (the flush trap the plan
  itself warned about — implemented alongside the queue, then confirmed by this test, rather than written
  test-first; the queue/flush pairing was designed as one unit since an unflushed queue is an obvious
  trade-count leak, not a subtle case worth discovering via a failing test first).
- Unit: 347/347 passed (up from 342), 6 skipped.
- Integration: 94/94 passed.
- Fast Simulation suite (golden/determinism, `RequiresCTrader!=true`): 120/120 passed, byte-identical
  (4m18s) — expected, since `HonestFills` defaults ON but the existing golden fixtures don't happen to run
  the tape venue in dual-resolution mode with a distinguishing M1 fixture; nothing to re-baseline.

## Working notes for future phases (carried from research, not yet acted on)

- `PositionManager.cs` maintains its OWN `_initialSlDistance` dictionary (private, per-position, used only
  for the `SteppedR` trailing method) — this is unrelated to the new `PositionState.InitialStopLoss` field
  and does NOT need to change for P0.1. Don't conflate the two when touching trailing code in later phases.
- `KernelDriver.cs` carries a "STATUS: skeleton for handover" doc-comment and is NOT the live journal writer
  — `KernelBacktestLoop.cs` + `SqliteStepRecordSink.cs` (background sink, `RawEvent`/`RawEffects` serialized
  off the pump thread) is the real path. If a later phase needs to touch journal writing, start there, not
  in `KernelDriver.cs`.
- The `Journal` table's `EventJson` is PascalCase, enums as member-name strings, value objects nested as
  `{"Value": ...}` (confirmed against live data, matches `RunNarrativeService.cs`'s doc-comment). Any future
  parsing code (P3 excursion recorder, P4 walk-forward) should reuse that same shape/casing assumption.

## P1 — TF-agnostic strategy bank — Done on `iter/quant-model--p1-tf-agnostic` (2026-07-04)

4 commits: P1.1 instance-per-row + de-harden H1, P1.2 EntryTimeframe on OrderProposed, P1.3 aux-TF bar preloading for mtf-trend, P1.4 HonestFills checkbox.

Gates: build 0, Unit 347/0/6, Integration 94/0, golden 63/63 byte-identical, npm 0, non-E2E Simulation 112/0.

Deviations from plan: aux-TF loading hardcoded to mtf-trend+H4 (not computing RequiredTimeframes union — only strategy with aux TFs currently). No M15 acceptance test (requires live M15 data not guaranteed by test harness). Warning chip and verdict funnel deferred to P2. Instance-per-row doesn't dedup duplicate (strategy,symbol,TF) rows in run plan — harmless, fix if profiling shows waste.

**2026-07-05 static review update:** the skipped M15 acceptance test turned out to be load-bearing — a
full code-trace review found the indicator-request layer never got de-hardcoded (still implicitly/explicitly
pinned to H1 in all 9 strategies) and a lookahead-bias bug in the aux-TF preload (mtf-trend's H4 EMA is
computed once from the full run range instead of point-in-time). See "Static-review findings" under
"Resume here" above and PLAN.md §3 P1.5 for the full trace and fix spec — P1.5 must land before P2.1.

## P2.1 — Indicator series API — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P1.5)

**What shipped:** `IndicatorSnapshotService` gained a capped ring buffer (last 64 values, latest last) per
sig key, written through a single `Emit(key, value)` point inside `RecomputeIndicatorsAsync` (replacing every
direct `IndicatorValues[key] = ...` assignment) so the series can never drift out of sync with the latest
value. New `GetSeries(key)` + `BuildStrategyIndicatorSeries(symbol, strategy)` (mirrors
`BuildStrategyIndicatorValues`'s shape). `MarketContext` gained an optional `IndicatorSeries` positional
parameter (default `null`, so every existing call site stays source-compatible) plus a
`MarketContextExtensions.GetSeries(key)` null-safe accessor. `BarEvaluator.EvaluateAsync` builds and passes
the series alongside the existing values dict.

Ported all 4 strategies PLAN.md flagged as having cadence-fragile private state, deleting the fields entirely:
- `MacdMomentumStrategy._lastHist` → reads `context.GetSeries("MACD_12_26_9_Histogram")[^2]`/`[^1]`.
- `SuperTrendStrategy._prevDirection` → reads the direction series, but scans BACKWARD from `[^2]` for the
  last VALID (±1) reading rather than blindly indexing `[^2]` — Skender emits an invalid/0 direction during
  its own internal warmup, and the old field only ever cached valid readings, so a naive index would have
  been a subtly different (looser) semantic than the field it replaced. Caught and fixed before landing, not
  after — see `SuperTrend_SkipsInvalidWarmupReadings_WhenScanningForPreviousDirection` in
  `SeriesBasedCrossDetectionTests.cs`.
- `MtfTrendStrategy._prevRsi` → reads `context.GetSeries("RSI_{period}")[^2]`/`[^1]` (RSI has no invalid
  sentinel, so a direct index is safe here).
- `BollingerSqueezeStrategy._bbWidthQueue` → derives the prior-width window from the BB Upper/Lower/Middle
  series (all three already tracked automatically by the ring buffer) instead of maintaining its own queue.
  `_cooldownRemaining`/`_squeezeActive` are legitimate trade-state (not fragility) and were left untouched.

**Test-infrastructure fallout (expected, fixed same session):** two existing test helpers construct
`MarketContext` without ever supplying `IndicatorSeries` (`StrategyTestHelper.MakeContext`'s callers), so
after the port they'd silently get an empty series forever and the 4 strategies would never fire — caught by
running the FULL gate, not assumed:
- `StrategySignalContractTests.cs`'s `CountSignals` — the strong ("must fire", not just "doesn't throw")
  regression lock for these strategies — went from 5/5 passing to 3 real failures (`MacdMomentum_emits_on_
  reversal`, `SuperTrend_emits_on_reversal`, `BollingerSqueeze_emits_on_squeeze_then_breakout`, all "found 0"
  signals). Fixed by accumulating a real growing per-key history alongside its existing per-bar indicator
  recompute and threading it through as the series.
- `StrategyScenarioTests.cs`'s 4 "DoesNotThrow" tests didn't fail (weak assertions) but would have silently
  stopped exercising real logic. Added `StrategyTestHelper.BuildFullSeries` (recomputes indicators at every
  bar count, building a genuine incremental series — the same shape production's ring buffer produces, just
  recomputed from scratch each step) and wired it through all 4 tests.
- Also fixed, while touching this file: `StrategyTestHelper.MakeContext` hardcoded the bars dictionary key to
  `Timeframe.H1` regardless of the bar's actual timeframe (the same test-helper gap P1.5.1 flagged but left
  alone at the time) — now uses `bar.Timeframe`. Harmless generalization; every existing caller only ever
  passes H1 bars.

New tests: `IndicatorSnapshotServiceSeriesTests` (4 — accumulation/latest-last ordering, 64-cap, unknown-key
empty, `BuildStrategyIndicatorSeries` shape) and `SeriesBasedCrossDetectionTests` (6 — one hand-worked
fixture per strategy proving the port preserves the exact same fire/no-fire semantics as the field it
replaced, including the SuperTrend invalid-warmup-reading edge case above).

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors; Unit 362/0/6 (+6 new); Integration 94/0; fast Simulation
(`RequiresCTrader!=true`) 128/0 (reran twice — first run hit an isolated 300s timeout in an unrelated cTrader-cli
E2E test under load, `GbpUsd_H1_30Days_ProducesTrades`, which passed in 41s standalone and in the full suite
on rerun (4m41s) — confirmed pre-existing environmental flake, not a P2.1 regression); Architecture 6/8 (2
pre-existing, unrelated files, undisturbed).

---

## P2.2 — rsi-divergence rewrite — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P2.1)

**What shipped:** deleted the P0-era tautology
(`rsiAtLowest = lowestIdx >= 0 ? rsi : rsi` — always the current RSI, so "divergence" was never actually
tested; net effect was "fade any fresh N-bar breakout with RSI on the expected side of 50", not divergence).

New `TradingEngine.Services.Helpers.PivotFinder` — a pure static fractal swing-high/low detector
(`FindSwingLows`/`FindSwingHighs`, non-repainting: a pivot needs `strength` bars with a strictly worse
extreme on EACH side, so the most recent `strength` bars can never themselves be a pivot). Built and unit
tested standalone (8 tests: single V, monotonic-no-pivot, tied-lows-not-a-pivot, W-shape two-pivot-in-order,
inverted-V high, too-few-bars, zero-strength-throws, non-repainting-at-the-tail) before touching the
strategy, per PLAN.md's own agent guidance.

`RsiDivergenceStrategy` rewritten: finds the two most recent confirmed swing lows (bullish) / highs
(bearish) within a `DivergenceLookback`-bar window (default bumped 10→**40→50** — see deviation below), reads
RSI at those EXACT bar positions from `context.GetSeries("RSI_{period}")` (P2.1), and requires: bullish =
price makes a LOWER low while RSI makes a HIGHER low, confirmed by the current bar's close breaking above
the more recent pivot's High; bearish mirrors on highs/a lower RSI high/breaking below the pivot's Low. SL
sits just beyond the confirming pivot (ATR-buffered). A new `_lastTradedPivotTime` field (legitimate
one-shot trade-state, not the cadence-fragility class P2.1 targeted) stops the same confirmed divergence
from re-firing every bar while price stays past the confirmation level.

**Deviation from plan — `DivergenceLookback` had to grow, twice.** The plan didn't specify a value; the
existing default (10) was sized for the OLD single-swing heuristic, not real divergence. A genuine
double-bottom/top (decline → bounce → second decline) easily spans 30-50+ bars — my first fixture's two
pivots landed 41 bars apart and were invisible to a `lookback+strength*2+1`-sized window (an even tighter
formula than the raw lookback). Fixed by (a) redefining the window as `min(bars, series, lookback)` — lookback
IS the total span searched, not margin around one point — and (b) raising the default to 50 (just under the
P2.1 series' 64-entry cap, leaving headroom). `RequiredBarCount` simplified to
`DivergenceLookback + RsiPeriod + 5`.

**Test-infrastructure fallout (caught by running the real gate, not assumed):**
`StrategySignalContractTests.CountSignals` only started accumulating its per-key series history from
`RequiredBarCount` onward, not from bar 0 — production's ring buffer fills from the engine's very first bar,
so by the time a strategy first gets evaluated it may already hold history reaching bars well before
`RequiredBarCount` (exactly the case for a divergence pivot pair straddling that boundary). Fixed by starting
accumulation at `i=0` and capping the history at 64 to mirror `IndicatorSnapshotService.SeriesCapacity`
exactly, evaluating the strategy only once `i >= RequiredBarCount` as before. Also replaced
`RsiDivergence_emits_on_reversal`'s fixture (`Reversal(140,140)`, a single monotonic reversal) — it tested
the OLD tautology's behavior (fires on any fresh breakout), not real divergence, which structurally needs a
SECOND pivot to diverge against. New `DoubleBottomDivergence()` fixture: a steep first decline (deeply
oversold RSI), a partial bounce, then a shallower/slower second decline reaching a lower absolute price
(textbook divergence — lower price low, higher RSI low), each leg ending in an explicit exaggerated-wick
pivot bar (adjacent legs otherwise share the exact transition price + wiggle, which **ties** under
PivotFinder's strict inequality and confirms no pivot at all — caught via a scratch diagnostic, not guessed).

New tests: `PivotFinderTests` (8), `RsiDivergenceStrategyTests` (4 — hand-injected series proving a real
bullish divergence fires, a same-direction "no divergence" case doesn't, a single-pivot case doesn't, and
the bar-count gate).

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors; Unit 380/0/6 (+18 new: 8 PivotFinder + 4 RsiDivergence + 6 carried from
P2.1's SeriesBasedCrossDetectionTests already counted); Integration 94/0; Simulation (owner request — see
gate-filter note above, cTrader-touching categories excluded for the rest of P2)
`RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 120/0 (~9s); Architecture 6/8 (2
pre-existing, unrelated files, undisturbed). Full cTrader-inclusive suite deferred to end-of-P2 per owner.

---

## P2.3 — Edge semantics (D5, D8) — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P2.1/P2.2)

**bb-squeeze latch expiry (D8).** New `_barsSinceLatched` counter: increments each bar the latch stays
armed without a new contraction re-arming it; once it exceeds `BbPeriod`, the latch clears
(`_squeezeActive = false`) so a stale contraction from weeks ago can no longer arm a breakout. Reset on
fire and in `Reset()`. New test `BollingerSqueeze_LatchExpires_AfterBbPeriodBarsWithoutBreakout` — confirmed
failing against the pre-fix code (a breakout ~21 bars after an old, expired latch incorrectly fired).

**trend-breakout single-fire (D5).** The old check re-fired on EVERY bar of a continuing trend (a monotonic
rise makes every bar a "fresh" N-bar high under a naive rolling-window comparison). Now only fires on a
false→true STATE TRANSITION: the current bar breaks its rolling window AND the prior bar did NOT break
ITS OWN (one-bar-earlier) rolling window — i.e. genuinely the first breakout bar of the run, not a
continuation. New `CooldownBars` param (default 5) additionally suppresses re-entry for a few bars after
any fire. New test `Evaluate_ContinuingMonotonicBreakout_FiresOnlyOnce_NotEveryBar` — confirmed 35 signals
(one per bar) pre-fix, 1 signal post-fix, on the same 35-bar monotonic run.

**ema-alignment edge conversion (D5).** Deleted the state CONDITION (`fast>slow AND price>fast` — true
every bar of any trend, despite the code comment claiming "crossover"). New edge, fully derived from bars +
the P2.1 EMA series (no private state at all — a stateless recomputation from history each call, so replay
of the same tape always gives the same answer regardless of call cadence): (1) a fast/slow crossover within
`CrossoverLookback` bars (new param, default 20), (2) no earlier bar since that crossover touched the fast
EMA, (3) THIS bar touches the fast EMA (the pullback) and closes back on the trend side (confirmation).
`RequiredBarCount` grew by `+CrossoverLookback` to give the window room. New tests (4, hand-injected series):
fires on a genuine crossover+first-touch, does NOT fire on a second touch after the same crossover, does NOT
fire on a sustained condition with no crossover event, insufficient-bars gate.

**Test-infrastructure fallout (caught by running the real gate, not assumed):**
- `StrategyCharacterizationTests.Signals()` had the same bar-0-vs-RequiredBarCount series-accumulation gap
  already fixed once in `StrategySignalContractTests.CountSignals` (P2.2) — fixed identically here.
- `EmaAlignment_FiresLong_OnCleanUptrend`'s `StrongTrend` fixture (a perfectly smooth trend from bar 0) can
  legitimately produce ZERO signals under the new pullback-entry semantics — a clean trend has no pullback
  to trade. Renamed to `EmaAlignment_FiresLong_OnUptrendWithPullback` with a new `TrendWithPullback` fixture:
  flat/ranging warmup (so the fast/slow EMA start converged — a trend running since bar 0 never shows a
  discrete crossover under the recompute-from-scratch test methodology, since Skender's EMA seed already has
  fast>slow by the time both are first computable) followed by a clean uptrend, then a pin-bar pullback
  (a deep lower wick, but the close stays on the trend side, confirming continuation) that genuinely touches
  the fast EMA. Took several iterations with scratch diagnostics to get the wick depth right (a shallow dip
  doesn't reach the EMA; too deep and the close itself falls below it, failing confirmation).
- `NonH1AcceptanceTests.M15Run_TrendBreakout_ProducesAtLeastOneProposal` (P1.5.1's M15 gate test) used a
  monotonic uptrend from bar 0 — the exact shape P2.3's single-fire logic no longer signals on once
  `RequiredBarCount` bars have passed (the trend is already mid-continuation by then). Fixed the fixture to a
  flat warmup for exactly `RequiredBarCount` bars, then the trend — same root cause and fix shape as the new
  `TrendBreakoutStrategyTests` single-fire test.

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors; Unit 386/0/6 (+6 new: 1 bb-squeeze latch-expiry, 1 trend-breakout
single-fire, 4 ema-alignment edge); Integration 94/0; Simulation
`RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 120/0 (~9s); Architecture 6/8 (2
pre-existing, unrelated files, undisturbed).

## P2.4 — Time-flatten behavior (D6) — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P2.1–P2.3)

**What shipped:** loop-level, per-strategy, daily time-flatten — closes every OPEN position a strategy
holds once the bar's time-of-day reaches that strategy's configured flatten time.

- `IStrategyConfig` gained an optional `TimeOnly? FlattenAtUtc => null` default interface member (touches
  zero of the 9 concrete config classes except the one override below — C# default interface members avoid
  a mechanical one-line edit across every strategy config).
- `SessionBreakoutConfig.FlattenAtUtc => Parameters.FlattenTimeUtc` wires the previously-dead
  `FlattenTimeUtc` (PLAN.md's own audit: zero readers repo-wide, confirmed again before writing this) into
  the new mechanism.
- New `KernelTimeFlattenEvaluator` (mirrors `KernelTrailingEvaluator`'s exact shape — the impure per-bar
  adapter pattern): for each Open position on the current bar's symbol, looks up its owning strategy's
  `Config.FlattenAtUtc`; if the bar's time-of-day has reached it, the position is due for flattening.
- **No new kernel event needed.** Research before implementing found `CloseRequested(PositionId, Reason,
  OccurredAtUtc)` already exists with a full, tested reducer handler
  (`EngineReducer.HandleCloseRequested` → `PositionLifecycle`'s `(Open, CloseRequested)` transition →
  emits `CloseOpenPosition`) — it just had zero callers anywhere in `src/`. This phase is its first real
  caller, reusing well-tested kernel logic instead of inventing a parallel force-close path.
- `KernelBacktestLoop` gained an `evaluateTimeFlatten` hook (same shape as `evaluateTrailing`: optional,
  default null so every existing call site — and the golden byte-identical guarantee — is untouched),
  invoked after trailing/breakeven each bar; each decision becomes a `CloseRequested` event, enqueued and
  pumped through the real reducer. Wired in `EngineRunner.BuildKernelLoop` via a new `_timeFlatten` field
  constructed alongside `_trailing`.

New tests: `KernelTimeFlattenEvaluatorTests` (4 — flattens at/after the time, not before, ignores strategies
with no `FlattenAtUtc`, ignores already-closed positions) and
`KernelLoop_TimeFlattenHook_ForceClosesOpenPosition` (proves the full wiring end-to-end through the real
`KernelBacktestLoop` — queue → pump → reducer → `CloseOpenPosition` effect — not just the evaluator in
isolation; a hook that unconditionally flattens closes the golden fixture's position with
`ExitReason == "TimeFlatten"`).

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors; Unit 386/0/6 (unchanged — new tests landed in Simulation, not Unit, since
they need `TradingEngine.Host`); Integration 94/0; Simulation
`RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 125/0 (+5 new, ~9s); Architecture 6/8
(2 pre-existing, unrelated files, undisturbed). Golden suite unaffected (`evaluateTimeFlatten` defaults
null on every existing call site).

---

## P2.5 — Thesis metadata — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P2.1–P2.4)

**What shipped:** each strategy config gains `thesis` (one-sentence falsifiable claim),
`expectedTradesPerWeek`, `expectedHoldBars` — persisted (not a hardcoded map), editable via the Strategies
API/UI, seeded from `config/strategies/*.json`. Used later by P4's frequency reality check (needed trades
≈ target% / (risk% × OOS avgR) vs actual).

- `StrategyConfigEntry` (Domain) + `StrategyConfigEntity` (Infrastructure) gain the 3 nullable fields.
  New EF migration `M35_StrategyThesis` (additive, nullable columns — no data loss on existing rows).
- `SqliteStrategyConfigStore` wires them through `ToEntity`/`ToEntry`/`UpsertAsync` (both insert and update
  paths).
- `StrategyConfigSeeder.LoadFromJson` parses `thesis`/`expectedTradesPerWeek`/`expectedHoldBars` from each
  strategy's JSON file.
- All 9 `config/strategies/*.json` files got a genuine one-sentence thesis + plausible
  expectedTradesPerWeek/expectedHoldBars, informed by each strategy's actual (post-P1/P2) entry logic —
  e.g. ema-alignment's thesis states the NEW P2.3 pullback-entry edge, not the old condition.
- **Found and fixed in passing:** `rsi-divergence.json`'s `parameters.divergenceLookback: 10` was still the
  OLD value — P2.2 changed the C# default to 50, but an explicit JSON value overrides the record default,
  so the SHIPPED config was still using the too-tight lookback that made real divergence unobservable
  (the exact bug P2.2 fixed in code silently didn't apply to the deployed default). Fixed to 50.
- **Found and fixed in passing:** `StrategyMetadataMap`'s entry-rule/exit-formula map (a separate,
  pre-existing static metadata table) had a dead entry keyed `"bollinger-squeeze"` — the real
  `[StrategyId]` is `"bb-squeeze"` (confirmed in `BollingerSqueezeStrategy.cs`), so this entry never
  matched anything `StrategiesController` looked up. Fixed the key.
- `StrategiesController` surfaces the 3 fields on both the list and detail GET endpoints, and accepts them
  in `UpdateConfig`. Angular `StrategySummary`/`StrategyDetail` types + the strategy list card + strategy
  detail edit form/read-only view all updated.

New tests: `StrategyConfigStoreTests` (3 — new-entry round-trip, update-existing round-trip, null-metadata
round-trip, all against a real in-memory SQLite `TradingDbContext`) and `StrategyConfigSeederTests` (1 —
seeds the REAL `config/strategies/*.json` files via the real seeder and asserts all 9 have non-blank thesis
metadata, so a future edit that silently drops a strategy's thesis fails loudly). The `rsi-divergence.json`
`divergenceLookback` regression above was caught by manual review while writing this section, not by a
test — noted here as a reminder that P2.2's C# default change doesn't retroactively fix an explicit JSON
override, and worth a general sweep if other P2 default changes (e.g. trend-breakout's new `CooldownBars`)
were ever made explicit in a JSON file too (checked: none were).

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors (including a retry past the known Angular build-race flake); Unit 386/0/6;
Integration 98/0 (+4 new); Simulation
`RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 125/0 (~9s); Architecture 6/8 (2
pre-existing, unrelated files, undisturbed). Angular `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## P2.6 — Units doctrine (D9) — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P2.1–P2.5)

**What shipped:** the 5 raw-pip config fields the audit flagged (`breakeven.offsetPips`, `limitOffsetPips`,
`stopLoss.maxPips`, `RiskProfile.MaxSlPips`, `maxSlippagePips`; `trailing.stepPips` too, though no shipped
config used it) each gain a nullable normalized companion — an ATR-multiple, ATR-fraction, or
spread-multiple. `UnitConversion` (new, `TradingEngine.Services`) is the one pure place a companion field
resolves into the SAME existing raw-pip field the rest of the codebase already reads — SlTpResolver,
PreTradeGate, EntryPlanner, PositionManager needed **zero** changes.

- **New fields (additive, all nullable, default null = "still on raw pips"):** `SlOptions.MaxSlAtrMultiple`,
  `BreakevenOptions.OffsetSpreadMultiple`, `TrailingOptions.StepAtrFraction`,
  `OrderEntryOptions.LimitOffsetAtrFraction`/`MaxSlippageSpreadMultiple`, `RiskProfile.MaxSlAtrMultiple`.
- **`UnitConversion`** (pure, `src/TradingEngine.Services/UnitConversion.cs`): `ReferenceAtrPips(tf, symbol)`
  wraps the existing `AddOnAutoTuner.ReferenceAtrPips` heuristic (spread × per-TF factor) — the SAME
  reference used in both directions (this session's JSON migration and every future resolution), so P3.4b's
  eventual measured-`ReferenceScales` upgrade is a drop-in swap for one function, not a rethink.
  `ResolvePips(this PositionManagementOptions, tf, symbol)` / `ResolvePips(this OrderEntryOptions, tf,
  symbol)` / `ResolveMaxSlPips(this RiskProfile, tf, symbol)` each override the raw-pip field ONLY when its
  companion multiple is set AND the reference scale is non-zero (a symbol with no configured spread never
  silently zeroes out a real limit — falls back to the raw pips instead).
- **Wiring — exactly 2 injection points, no strategy code touched:**
  1. `StrategyRegistry.CreateStrategies` (Host): in the run-plan branch, right after `boundEntry` binds the
     row's `Symbol`/`EntryTimeframe` (the existing D1 instance-per-row seam), resolve `SymbolInfo` via
     `ISymbolInfoRegistry.TryGet` and — if found — run `PositionManagement`/`OrderEntry` through
     `ResolvePips`. One-time (per strategy instance), not per-bar: symbol+TF are fixed for the instance's
     lifetime.
  2. `BarEvaluator.cs` (right after `riskProfileResolver.Resolve(intent.RiskProfileId)`, the existing K4
     gap-1 per-proposal profile resolution): chain `.ResolveMaxSlPips(tf, symbolInfo)` — the only point
     where the resolved profile, the firing strategy's symbol, AND its timeframe are all in scope together.
- **Config linter** (`TradingEngine.Infrastructure.Configuration.ConfigLinter`, pure over `JsonElement`):
  fails when a strategy/profile JSON has a raw-pip KEY explicitly present without its normalized companion
  key. Wired into `StrategyConfigSeeder.SeedAsync` UNCONDITIONALLY at the top (before the "already seeded,
  skip" early-return — a hand-edit must fail startup every time, not just on the very first seed) and into a
  new `lint-config` CLI verb on `TradingEngine.Host` (`dotnet run --project src/TradingEngine.Host --
  lint-config`), following the existing `experiment` sub-command dispatch pattern in `Program.cs`.
- **Backward compat (one-iteration deprecation window, per plan):** old raw-pip fields are NOT deleted from
  JSON this iteration; the resolver prefers the new companion when present, otherwise reads the raw field
  unchanged — zero behavior change for any config that doesn't set a companion.
- **JSON migration — all 13 files** (`config/strategies/*.json` ×9, `config/risk-profiles/*.json` ×4) gained
  their normalized companion, computed from each field's CURRENT value against the EURUSD-H1 reference scale
  (the implicit assumption baked into every number before P1 de-hardcoded H1) — e.g. `maxSlPips: 100.0` →
  `maxSlAtrMultiple: 5.0` (`100 / ReferenceAtrPips(H1, EURUSD) = 100/20`). This is numerically a no-op for
  EURUSD H1 (today's only real data) but now scales correctly for any other symbol/TF a run-plan row picks —
  e.g. the SAME `standard` profile's `maxSlAtrMultiple: 5.0` resolves to 3000 pips on XAUUSD-H1 instead of
  silently reusing the flat 100-pip forex cap that would reject or crush every gold stop. Added
  `maxSlAtrMultiple` to ALL 9 strategies' `stopLoss` (not just bb-squeeze/mtf-trend, the only 2 that
  explicitly overrode `maxPips`) so the gold/crypto fix isn't partial. Left `trailing.stepAtrFraction`
  unadded anywhere — no shipped config sets `trailing.stepPips` (all use `Method: AtrMultiple`/`Structure`,
  where `StepPips` is dead), so there was no raw-pip key for the linter to flag.

New tests: `UnitConversionTests` (11 — EURUSD-vs-XAUUSD scaling proof for all 5 fields, multiple-absent
no-op, zero-reference-scale doesn't zero out a real limit), `ConfigLinterTests` (6 — pure `JsonElement`
rule checks), `ConfigLinterRealFilesTests` (1, Integration — the REAL shipped configs lint clean; the
regression net for a future hand-edit), `StrategyRegistryTests` (+1 — binding the SAME `trend-breakout`
config to EURUSD vs XAUUSD via `ISymbolInfoRegistry.TryGet` produces `MaxPips` 100 vs 3000, proving the
`StrategyRegistry` wiring is genuinely symbol-aware end-to-end, not just at the pure-function level).

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors; Unit 397/0/6 (+11); Integration 99/0 (+1); Simulation
`RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 126/0 (+1, ~10s); Architecture 6/8 (2
pre-existing, unrelated files, undisturbed); `dotnet run --project src/TradingEngine.Host -- lint-config`
against the real repo → "Config lint: OK".

## P2.7 — Stop orders (`OrderType.Stop` end-to-end) — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P2.1–P2.6)

**Bug found and fixed (same bug class this phase exists to close):** `OrderType.Stop` already existed in
the enum and flowed correctly through `OrderProposed`/`OrderSubmitted`/`PositionLifecycle`, but TWO places
silently collapsed it back to Market/Limit before reaching a venue — both traced by direct code read, not
guessed:
1. The `SubmitOrder` effect record (`EngineEffects.cs`) carried NO `OrderType` field at all, so
   `Kernel.DecideProposed` (the kernel/production path per iter-36) had nowhere to put `p.OrderType` when
   building the effect — it silently dropped it.
2. `EffectExecutor`'s `SubmitOrder` handler re-derived the type from `submit.LimitPrice is not null ?
   OrderType.Limit : OrderType.Market` — a derivation that can't distinguish Stop from Limit (both ride on
   a resting trigger price). Any kernel-path Stop proposal would have gone out to the venue as `Limit`.
3. **Drive-by fix, same bug class:** `PositionTracker.TrackOrder` (the legacy imperative live-trading path)
   hardcoded `OrderType.Market` on the `OrderSubmitted` event instead of reading `request.Type` — the
   `OrderRequest` passed in already carried the correct type (`TradingLoop.cs` sets it from
   `intent.OrderType` before calling `TrackOrder`), so this was pure data loss with no reason to exist.
   `PositionTracker.SeedOpenPositions`'s own `OrderType.Market` hardcode is untouched — that one is correct
   (reconciling an already-filled venue position, no live order-type decision there).

**Fix:** `SubmitOrder` gained an `OrderType OrderType = OrderType.Market` field (additive default — every
pre-existing direct-construct call site stays source-compatible); `Kernel.cs` threads `p.OrderType` through;
`EffectExecutor` uses `submit.OrderType` directly for both the rebuilt `TradeIntent` and `OrderRequest.Type`;
`PositionTracker.TrackOrder` reads `request.Type`. New regression test
`Kernel_PreservesStopOrderType_ThroughSubmitOrderEffect` (`KernelEvaluatorEquivalenceTests.cs`) proves a
Stop-typed proposal survives `OrderProposed → Kernel.DecideProposed → SubmitOrder` effect without
collapsing to Market or Limit.

**Venue fill logic — both replay adapters.** Added `_pendingStops`/`PendingStop` (mirrors
`_pendingLimits`/`PendingLimit` exactly) to `BacktestReplayAdapter` and `TapeReplayAdapter`. `SubmitOrderAsync`
branches on `request.Type == OrderType.Stop && request.LimitPrice is { } stop` — reusing the SAME
`LimitPrice` field as the generic "resting trigger price" for both Limit and Stop (the domain convention
already established; a distinct `StopPrice` field would have been unnecessary churn). Trigger direction is
the MIRROR of a limit order: a buy stop fills when the ask crosses UP THROUGH the trigger (breakout
confirmation, same long-entry spread convention as a market/limit buy); a sell stop fills when the raw bid
crosses DOWN THROUGH it (same short-entry no-spread-adjustment convention). Gap-through-at-open reuses the
exact rule `ProcessSlTpHits` already applies to SL gap-through (F6): if the bar's open already lies beyond
the trigger, fill at the (worse) open instead of the trigger price. Same expiry semantics as limits
(`BarsRemaining` from `LimitOrderExpiryBars`, `ENTRY_EXPIRED` on expiry). `ProcessPendingStops` wired into
`OnBarObserved` alongside every existing `ProcessPendingLimits` call site, including TapeReplayAdapter's
dual-resolution fine-bar loop. `_pendingStops` cleared in both adapters' dispose paths.

**cTrader adapter.** `CTraderBrokerAdapter.SubmitOrderAsync` derives `isLimit` from
`entryOpts?.Method == OrderEntryMethod.LimitOffset` (unchanged) and now ALSO derives `isStop` from
`request.Type == OrderType.Stop` (new, additive — `request.Type` is the only reliable signal for a brand
new order type with no existing callers). Reuses the existing `limitPrice`/`expiryBars` wire fields as the
generic trigger/expiry for either resting type. New test `StopIntent_ProducesStopOrderFrame`
(`FakeTransportTests.cs`) proves the wire frame carries `orderType: "Stop"` with the trigger price
populated; the pre-existing `LimitOffsetIntent_ProducesLimitOrderFrame` proves `isLimit` is untouched.

**Caught mid-phase and deliberately NOT fixed here:** first attempt derived `orderTypeStr` from
`request.Type` directly for BOTH Limit and Stop (matching both replay venues, and looking like a clean
generalization). Running the full cTrader-inclusive gate turned up a real regression:
`PipelineE2ETests.EurUsd_H1_3Days_ProducesTrades` and `EurUsd_H1_ThreeMonth_GeneratesAtLeastOneTrade`
(a real cTrader-CLI backtest) both dropped from producing trades to **zero**. Root cause: on the KERNEL
path, `EffectExecutor`'s `SubmitOrder` handler rebuilds a bare `TradeIntent` with no `Entry` attached, so
`entryOpts` has ALWAYS been null there — meaning `isLimit` has ALWAYS evaluated false regardless of
`request.Type`, and every kernel-path order (even a genuine domain `Limit` order from a LimitOffset-
configured strategy — the default `OrderEntry.Method` for all 9 shipped strategies) has always gone out to
cTrader as `"Market"`. That's a real, previously-undiscovered gap in the cTrader integration (a Limit order
placed via the kernel path has apparently never actually rested at cTrader — `PlaceLimitOrder` may be
effectively dead code on that path), but fixing it is out of scope for "add Stop orders" and risks silently
changing trade counts on runs the owner already relies on. Reverted `isLimit`'s derivation to the original
`entryOpts.Method` check (zero behavior change for any strategy shipped today) and added `isStop` as a
narrow, independent addition keyed on `request.Type` (safe — no strategy produces a Stop order yet, so
there is nothing to regress). Flagging the underlying gap here for a future phase to investigate
deliberately, with the owner's sign-off, rather than fixing it as a side effect.

**cBot.** `ExecuteSubmitOrder` gained an `orderType == "Stop" && limitPrice > 0` branch calling the cAlgo
Robot API's `PlaceStopOrder` (same obsolete-overload pattern already used for `PlaceLimitOrder`, confirmed
by a full solution build — the cAlgo.API method exists and compiles clean, no cTrader-cli needed to verify
this). Widened the pending-registration condition to `(orderType == "Limit" || orderType == "Stop")` so a
resting stop also gets tracked for expiry. Renamed `_pendingLimits`/`PendingLimitEntry` →
`_pendingEntryOrders`/`PendingEntryOrder` (small, contained) since the dict now tracks both kinds — the
expiry/cancel logic (`ProcessLimitExpiry`) was already order-kind-agnostic and needed no logic change.

**`EntryPlanner` — new `StopConfirm` method.** Per the plan: "buy stop at signal bar high + spread-multiple
buffer" (sell mirrors on the bar's Low). `Plan`'s signature gained an optional `Bar? bar` parameter (default
null, so it's source-compatible) — needed because `StopConfirm` requires the signal bar's High/Low, which
the pre-existing `signalPrice` (tick mid) can't provide. Both real call sites already had the bar in scope
(`BarEvaluator.cs` already builds a domain `Bar` locally for its indicator window; `TradingLoop.cs`'s
`ProcessBarAsync(Bar bar, ...)` parameter IS the domain `Bar`) — updated both to pass it through. New
`OrderEntryOptions.StopConfirmBufferSpreadMultiple` (default 1.0) — a dedicated field, not a reuse of
`MaxSlippagePips`/`MaxSlippageSpreadMultiple` (those govern post-fill slippage tolerance, a different
concept from this pre-fill trigger buffer). Extracted the SL/TP distance-preserving shift logic (previously
inline in `PlanLimitOffset`) into a shared `ShiftSlTp` helper, reused by both `PlanLimitOffset` and
`PlanStopConfirm`. New `EntryPlannerTests.cs` (none existed before — 8 tests): Market/MarketWithSlippage
unaffected (regression), LimitOffset long+short (regression, extracted from the pre-existing inline logic),
StopConfirm long (bar.High + buffer) and short (bar.Low − buffer) with hand-computed SL/TP shifts, buffer
scales with the configured multiple, and a defensive no-bar-supplied fallback (signalPrice as the bar
extreme — shouldn't happen from the real call sites, both of which always have the bar, but keeps `Plan`
total rather than throwing if a future/test caller omits it).

**Scope boundary (deliberate, not an oversight):** none of the 9 shipped `config/strategies/*.json` configs
were switched to `StopConfirm` in this phase. Which strategy should demand confirmation vs. instant entry is
a strategy-tuning/experiment decision, not part of "add the order-type plumbing end-to-end" — the plan text
lists rsi-divergence and "any breakout strategy" as *future consumers* of this mechanism, not a mandate to
convert them now. Deferred, same as P0.3 documented its own known-gap section.

New tests: `BacktestReplayStopOrderTests` (5 — buy/sell stop reached with no gap, buy/sell gap-through-at-open,
expiry), `TapeReplayStopOrderTests` (5 — same cases, single-resolution mode), `EntryPlannerTests` (8, see
above), `Kernel_PreservesStopOrderType_ThroughSubmitOrderEffect` (1), `StopIntent_ProducesStopOrderFrame` (1,
`FakeTransportTests.cs`). All fill-price/gap-through numbers hand-computed against a 2-pip spread fixture
before running, mirroring `BacktestReplaySpreadConventionTests`'/`TapeReplaySpreadConventionTests`' existing
convention — every new test passed on the first run, which is corroborating (not conclusive) evidence the
hand-derived fill-direction logic was reasoned correctly rather than reverse-fit to whatever the code did.

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors (full solution, including the cBot's net6.0/cAlgo.API target — confirms
`PlaceStopOrder` compiles without a running cTrader-cli); Unit 416/0/6 (+19); Integration 99/0 (unchanged —
no new integration tests this phase); Simulation
`RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 127/0 (+1, ~10s, byte-identical golden
fixtures — `Plan`'s new `bar` parameter defaults null and every existing call site passes the bar, but no
existing config uses `StopConfirm` so no existing fixture's behavior changes); Architecture 6/8 (same 2
pre-existing failures — `EngineReducer.cs:436`, `VenueSessionEntity` — neither file touched this phase).

## P3.1 — Excursion recorder — Done (2026-07-05, same session as P2.1–P2.7)

Per PLAN.md §P3.1 (the owner's "utilize MAE/MFE automatically" ask): tape-only, opt-in per-trade excursion
path capture, feeding P3.3's eventual ExitReplayer without any engine re-runs.

**What shipped — the full write-through chain, threaded the same way P0.1's `InitialStopLoss` and the
existing `CloseReason` already travel from venue to persisted trade (same precedent, same shape, not
invented fresh):**
- `ExecutionEvent.ExcursionPathJson` (new optional `init` property) — set by a venue that recorded a path,
  on a FULL close only (never on entry fills, partial fills, rejections, or cancellations).
- `OrderFilled.ExcursionPathJson` — carried from `ExecutionEvent` by `KernelFeedback.FromExecution`'s
  `OrderState.Filled` branch (mirrors how `CloseReason`/`GrossProfit` already travel there).
- `PublishTradeClosed.ExcursionPathJson` (new, nullable, default null) — threaded through at all 4
  `PublishTradeClosed` construction sites in `PositionLifecycle.cs` (the same 4 sites P0.1 found and
  touched for `InitialStopLoss` — partial-close, open→closed, reducing→closed, closing→closed).
- `EffectExecutor.HandlePublishTradeClosed` reads `effect.ExcursionPathJson` and threads it into a new
  `TradeClosed.ExcursionPathJson` parameter — kept OFF `TradeResult`/`TradeResultEntity` by design (a
  separate `TradeExcursions` table, not a new trade column, per the plan's own "a few hundred bytes/trade"
  framing — the path isn't a queryable trade field).
- `TradePersistenceHandler`'s existing trade-persistence channel (the literal "write-through the existing
  trade persistence channel" the plan asked for) had its tuple widened to
  `(TradeResult, RunId, ExcursionPathJson)`; `DrainAsync` calls a new
  `PersistenceService.SaveExcursionAsync` alongside the existing `SaveTradeAsync`, only when the path is
  non-null.
- New `IExcursionRepository`/`SqliteExcursionRepository`/`TradeExcursionEntity` (implements
  `IAuditableEntity`, confirmed via the Architecture gate — no new pre-existing-style gap introduced) +
  `TradeExcursionMapping` + `TradeExcursions(Id, RunId, PositionId, PathJson, CreatedAtUtc, UpdatedAtUtc)`
  table, unique-indexed on `(RunId, PositionId)`. EF migration `M36_TradeExcursions` (generated against the
  `TradingDbContext` context specifically — this solution has 3 DbContexts, `dotnet ef migrations add`
  needs `--context TradingDbContext` or it refuses to pick one).

**`TapeReplayAdapter` — the actual recorder, tape-only per the plan (mirrors P0.3's tape-only precedent;
`BacktestReplayAdapter` untouched):**
- New `recordExcursions` constructor parameter (default `false` — unlike `HonestFills`, which defaults ON,
  this is opt-in instrumentation for the exploration/exit-lab workflow, not a default behavior change).
- `RecordExcursionPoints(Bar bar)`: for every OPEN trade, appends `(minutesSinceEntry, hiPips, loPips)` —
  raw bar-high/low-vs-entry pip distances, direction-agnostic (the sign says which side of entry the bar's
  extreme reached; MAE/MFE interpretation — which side is favorable — is deliberately left to the
  downstream P3.3 ExitReplayer, not baked in here). `minutesSinceEntry` is whole minutes (fine bars are
  M1, so this is exact, not approximate) — far more compact than a repeated ISO timestamp per point, and
  the plan's own "a few hundred bytes/trade" framing rules out anything heavier.
- Wired into BOTH of `OnBarObserved`'s branches: the single-resolution short-circuit (using the decision
  bar itself, same graceful-fallback pattern the class already uses for exits when no finer data exists)
  and the dual-resolution fine-bar loop (per M1 bar, alongside `ProcessPendingStops`/`ProcessSlTpHits`) —
  called BEFORE `ProcessSlTpHits` each time, so the bar that actually triggers the close still gets its own
  excursion point recorded (a bar can spike favorably right before hitting a stop; that spike still matters
  for MAE/MFE).
- `TakeExcursionPathJson(orderId)` serializes + removes the accumulated path (compact `{t,hi,lo}` JSON
  array), wired into the CLOSE `ExecutionEvent` in both `ProcessSlTpHits`'s close branch AND `CloseAtAsync`
  (the engine-requested force-close path) — the two places a FULL close actually happens in this adapter.
  Partial closes (`ClosePartialPositionAsync`) are untouched: they route to `OrderPartiallyFilled`, which
  never reaches `PublishTradeClosed`, so there's nothing to attach there — the position stays open and its
  path keeps accumulating.
- `RecordExcursions` wired end-to-end: `BacktestOrchestrator.cs`'s `CustomParams["RecordExcursions"]`
  (same pattern as `HonestFills`/`GovernorEnabled`), default OFF, reaching the `TapeReplayAdapter`
  constructor — so it's actually reachable from a real run, not just a dead constructor parameter.

**Test-infrastructure note:** the new `TradeExcursionEntity`/DbSet had no migration for one build — caught
by running the Integration gate (37 failures, `PendingModelChangesWarning`, the exact WebSmokeTests trap
P0.1's own notes already flagged) before this phase's commit, not after. Fixed by generating
`M36_TradeExcursions` against the correct (`TradingDbContext`) context.

New tests: `TapeReplayExcursionRecorderTests` (3 — long position accumulates across 2 fine bars and
attaches on an SL-hit close with hand-computed pip values; short position accumulates across 1 fine bar and
attaches on a force-close via `ClosePositionAsync`, exercising the OTHER wiring point; `RecordExcursions=false`
— the default — produces a `null` path on the identical SL-hit scenario the long test uses, proving zero
behavior change when the flag is off), `Excursion_SaveAndRetrieve_RoundTrips`
(`TradeRepositoryTests.cs`, Integration — round-trips a path through real SQLite, and confirms two different
`(RunId, PositionId)` keys don't collide). All hand-computed pip/minute values passed on the first run.

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors; Unit 419/0/6 (+3); Integration 100/0 (+1, after the migration fix above);
Simulation `RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 127/0 (unchanged — byte-
identical, since `RecordExcursions` defaults off and no existing fixture turns it on); Architecture 6/8
(same 2 pre-existing failures, `TradeExcursionEntity` itself correctly implements `IAuditableEntity` so it
is NOT a new item in that failure's list).

---

## P3.2 — Exploration mode (one-click preset) — Done (2026-07-05, same session)

Per PLAN.md §P3.2: a named one-click run preset (SL=ATR×4, TP=none, BE/trail/partials OFF, governor OFF,
`RecordExcursions=true`). All underlying toggles already existed; this phase wired them into one preset.

### What shipped

**Backend:**
- `StartRunRequest` (DTO) gained `RecordExcursions` and `ExplorationMode` boolean fields (additive, defaults
  false — zero change for existing callers).
- `RunsController.Start` wires both into `CustomParams` (same pattern as `HonestFills`/`StripAddOns`).
- `EffectiveConfigResolver.ApplyExplorationPreset` (new static, parallels `StripAddOns`): forces every
  strategy to SL=ATR×4 (`Method="AtrMultiple", AtrMultiple=4.0`), TP=none (`Method="None"` — already
  supported by `SlTpResolver.ResolveTakeProfit` which returns `null` for it), and all enrichments off.
- `BacktestOrchestrator.BuildLoadedConfigFromDbAsync`: exploration preset applied AFTER strip-add-ons
  (when both are on), so it's the final word — an exploration run is provably free of packs AND add-ons.
- `BacktestRunState` gained `ExplorationMode`/`RecordExcursions` fields set from CustomParams at `Start()`.

**Frontend:**
- Angular `StartRunRequest` interface gained `recordExcursions?` / `explorationMode?`.
- New "Record excursions (MAE/MFE path)" checkbox in the Protections section alongside Honest Fills.
- New "Exploration Mode" toggle button: when on, forces stripAddOns+governorOff+recordExcursions+honestFills
  all at once. Toggle off restores the previous state.
- Both fields persisted/restored in saved setups (localStorage).

**Static-audit fixes riding along:**
- **B1 fix:** `WriteStartRecordAsync`'s content-address identity now includes `honestFills`, `recordExcursions`,
  and `exitTimeframe` — a re-run with only these toggles changed now gets a genuinely different `ConfigSetId`
  (was silently colliding before).
- **B2 comment:** `TapeReplayAdapter.ClosePartialPositionAsync` now has a code comment explaining why
  `ExcursionPathJson` is absent (position stays open, path keeps accumulating — the full close takes the
  complete path).
- **B3 doc:** `OPEN-ISSUES.md` C1 marked RESOLVED by P0.2 (full-spread convention already fixed it; the
  issue was stale since 2026-07-03).

**New tests:** `ExplorationPresetTests` (3 — `ApplyExplorationPreset` forces wide SL+no TP+no add-ons;
  idempotent on already stripped input; chaining strip-then-preset produces same final state as
  direct-from-original).

**Gate:** `dotnet build` 0 errors (full solution incl. Angular); Unit 434/0/6 (+15 new — 3 exploration
preset + 12 P3.3 tests below); Integration 100/0; Simulation
`RequiresCTrader!=true&Category!=E2E&Category!=Slow&Category!=NetMQ` 127/0 (~11s, byte-identical since
exploration mode defaults off and no existing fixture turns it on); Angular `tsc --noEmit` clean.

---

## P3.3 — ExitReplayer service (pure exit lab) — Done (2026-07-05, same session)

Per PLAN.md §P3.3: a pure function that replays exit rules against recorded excursion paths to compute
expectancy/win%/avg-hold/DD-contribution per cell — thousands of exit configs × thousands of trades in
milliseconds, zero engine re-runs.

### Architecture: where logic vs app lives

Following existing convention, the pure engine/logic stays close to the engine in
`TradingEngine.Services/ExitLab/`; the app-facing pieces (controller, UI) are deferred to P3.5 (Exit Lab UI):

| Component | Where | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `ExitReplayer.cs` | `TradingEngine.Services/ExitLab/` | Pure static math over paths — engine-adjacent |
| `ExitGridEvaluator.cs` | `TradingEngine.Services/ExitLab/` | Parallel grid runner — engine-adjacent |
| `ExitModels.cs` | `TradingEngine.Services/ExitLab/` | Data types (ExitRule, ExitOutcome, etc.) |
| Exit Lab API controller | P3.5 (future) | `TradingEngine.Web/Api/` — app layer |
| Exit Lab heatmap UI | P3.5 (future) | `web-ui/` Angular component |
| `ExitCalibrations` table | P3.4 (future) | Persistence — next phase |

### What shipped

**`ExitModels.cs`** — core data types:
- `ExcursionPoint(int MinutesSinceEntry, double HiPips, double LoPips)` — path point format (signed pip
  distances from entry, same as P3.1's recorded format).
- `TradeExcursionInput` — one trade: direction, entry price, initial SL, pip size, spread, path.
- `ExitRule` — one cell: SL multiple, TP multiple (nullable = no TP), BE trigger, trail multiple,
  partial TP, reference ATR in pips.
- `ExitOutcome` — per-trade output: ExitKind, bars held, R-pips, R-multiple, MAE/MFE.
- `ExitGridResult` — per-cell aggregate: trade count, win rate, avg/median R, avg hold, worst DD, R values
  (for P(pass) feed).

**`ExitReplayer.cs`** — pure static `Replay(TradeExcursionInput, ExitRule) → ExitOutcome`. Key design
decisions (documented in code, matching the venue's behavior):
1. **SL-first-conservative:** when both SL and TP hit the same bar, SL wins.
2. **Bar-processing order matches venue:** check exits at CURRENT stop/target levels, THEN update BE/trail
   from the bar's extreme (the venue's `KernelTrailingEvaluator` runs AFTER bar-close, not during).
3. **Direction-handling via pips from entry:** hiPips/loPips are signed (positive = above entry). The
   replayer derives favorable/adverse interpretation from trade direction — long: hi=favorable, lo=adverse;
   short: lo=favorable, hi=adverse.
4. **Short TP detection fix:** during construction, the original `-loPips >= tpTgt` (which passes for any
   positive lo vs negative TP target) was corrected to `loPips <= tpTgt` (both negative for short winners).
5. **End-of-data:** if no exit fires by path end, closes at the last bar's adverse extreme (bid for long,
   ask for short).
6. **R-multiple vs initial stop (P0.1-honest):** `R = (exit_pips / risk_pips) × dir_sign`, computed from the
   initial SL distance, not the trailed SL.

**`ExitGridEvaluator.cs`** — `Evaluate(trades, rules) → ExitGridCell[]`. Runs cells in parallel via
`Parallel.ForEach` (trivially parallel — each cell is independent). `GenerateGrid(referenceAtrPips,
slMultiples, tpMultiples, beTriggers, trailMultiples)` produces the Cartesian product. Default dimensions
(9 SL × 9 TP × 5 BE × 8 trail = 3,240 cells) complete in milliseconds.

**New tests (12):**
- `ExitReplayerTests` (9 — Long TP hit, Long SL hit, SL-first when both hit same bar, Short SL hit, Short
  TP hit, BE triggers then SL at BE level, Trail follows then stops out, EndOfData returns last bar close,
  Empty path returns zero R).
- `ExitGridEvaluatorTests` (3 — single-cell aggregate correctness, multi-cell parallel runs correctly, no-TP
  rule produces only SL/EndOfData outcomes).

**Validation gate note:** PLAN.md's P3.3 validation gate ("replaying the exit rule an actual run used must
reproduce that run's exits within one fine bar / tick-size tolerance") is currently deferred — it requires
a real completed tape run with `RecordExcursions=true` + actual `TradeResults` in the DB to feed paths into.
The first real exploration-mode run (P3.2) will produce that data. This test should be written as an
integration test (`Phase33Tests/ExitReplayerValidationGateTests.cs`) once that data exists, fed via
`IExcursionRepository.GetAsync` + `ITradeRepository`.

---

## P3.4 — Calibration tables — Done (2026-07-05, P3 wrap-up session)

Per PLAN.md §P3.4: store calibrated exit rules per (strategy×symbol×TF×regime), teach AddOnResolver to read them.

### What shipped
- `AddOnMode.Calibrated` added to the enum (alongside `Auto`, `Custom`).
- `ExitCalibrationRecord` (Domain) + `IExitCalibrationLookup` (Domain, sync interface — single DB lookup per position registration).
- `ExitCalibrationEntity` + `EF mapping + DbSet` in `TradingDbContext` — unique index on `(StrategyId, Symbol, EntryTimeframe, Regime)`.
- `ReferenceScaleEntity` + mapping — unique index on `(Symbol, EntryTimeframe)` — schema only; population logic deferred to P4.
- `SqliteExitCalibrationLookup` (Infrastructure) — sync EF Core lookup.
- `AddOnResolver` refactored: accepts optional `IExitCalibrationLookup`, branches on `Mode=Calibrated` per add-on (trailing/BE/partial), falls back to Auto when no calibration row exists. Signature changed from `(opts, tf, vol)` to `(opts, strategyId, symbol, tf, vol)` — callers updated.
- `KernelTrailingEvaluator` passes through `strategyId` and `symbol` to the resolver on position registration.
- `EngineRunner` wires `deps.Strategies.ExitCalibrationLookup` into `AddOnResolver` constructor.
- `EngineWorkerDependencies.StrategyServices` gained `ExitCalibrationLookup` property; `EngineServiceCollectionExtensions` resolves it from DI.
- Registered as `AddScoped<IExitCalibrationLookup, SqliteExitCalibrationLookup>()` in both Web (`ServiceRegistration`) and Host (`EngineServiceCollectionExtensions`) projects.
- `ExitLabController` endpoints: `POST /api/exit-lab/calibrations` (upsert), `GET /api/exit-lab/calibrations` (list with optional strategyId/symbol filters).
- EF migration `M37_ExitCalibrations` — adds `ExitCalibrations` and `ReferenceScales` tables.

New tests: `AddOnResolverTests` updated to pass new `(strategyId, symbol)` params (3 existing tests still pass).

### P3.5 — Exit Lab UI — Done (same session)

Per PLAN.md §P3.5: API controller + Angular page for running exit-grid evaluations and saving calibrations.

- **`ExitLabController`** (`POST /api/exit-lab/evaluate`): accepts `ExitLabEvaluateRequest` (runIds, positionIds, referenceAtrPips, optional custom grid dimensions), loads excursion paths from `IExcursionRepository`, parses JSON, builds `TradeExcursionInput` list, runs `ExitGridEvaluator.Evaluate()` via generated grid, returns per-cell aggregate stats.
- **`GET /api/trades/{id}/excursions`** on `TradesController`: returns `TradeExcursionResponse` with the raw `PathJson` for one trade — surfaces the P3.1 persisted paths.
- **Angular `/exit-lab` page** (`ExitLabComponent`): strategy/symbol/TF picker fields, reference ATR input, comma-separated run/position ID inputs, "Evaluate Grid" button, results table (SL×/TP×/BE×/Trail×/AvgR/Win%/MedR/Hold/MaxDD), click-to-select a row, "Save Calibration" button to upsert into `ExitCalibrations`. Lazy-loaded route, nav link in the top bar.
- **Angular trade-detail page**: loads excursion path via the new API, renders a mini bar chart (green=favorable, red=adverse) for MAE/MFE over time.
- **Angular `TradesApiService`**: new `getExcursions(id)` method.
- **API types**: `TradeExcursionResponse`, `ExitLabEvaluateRequest/Response`, `ExitLabCellResponse`, `SaveCalibrationRequest` added to `api.types.ts`.

UX fixes (Phase G, riding along):
- `applyExplorationPreset()`: when toggling exploration mode OFF, now restores `honestFills = true` (was silently leaving it at the previous manual value).
- `RecordExcursions` checkbox: unchanged — always visible (the plan's P3.1 scope explicitly limits recording to tape-only; a venue guard on the checkbox is a UX nicety deferred to P4).

## P4.5 — Close P3/P4 static-review gaps — **In progress** (2026-07-05)

Three of seven sub-phases landed this session. See `docs/iterations/iter-quant-model/PLAN.md` §3 P4.5 for the
full specification of all 7 fixes + §9 for evidence workflow, test policy, and per-phase direction.

### P4.5.2 — Exit Lab JSON format mismatch — **Done**

**Commit:** `fix(P4.5.2): Exit Lab JSON format mismatch — shared ExcursionPathCodec + malformed-path tracking`

Root cause: `TapeReplayAdapter.TakeExcursionPathJson` serialized `[{t,hi,lo},...]` (array of objects);
`ExitLabController.ParsePoints` deserialized `List<List<double>>` (array of arrays) → `JsonException` →
swallowed by `catch { return []; }` → every trade silently skipped → `/api/exit-lab/evaluate` always
returned 0 trades/0 cells.

Fix:
- New `ExcursionPathCodec` (TradingEngine.Services/ExitLab) — single `Serialize`/`Parse` used by both
  the recorder and controller, so the format can never drift apart again
- `TapeReplayAdapter`: deleted private `ExcursionPoint` duplicate; uses shared one from Services + codec
- `ExitLabController`: deleted `ParsePoints`; uses `codec.Parse` with a try/catch that increments
  `MalformedPathCount` (new field on `ExitLabEvaluateResponse`) instead of vanishing silently
- `ExitLabEvaluateResponse` DTO + Angular `api.types.ts` gain `malformedPathCount`

New tests: 11 unit tests (`ExcursionPathCodecTests`): round-trip, null/empty/whitespace, malformed throws,
object-vs-array mismatch, rounding, backward-compatible with live DB's existing `{t,hi,lo}` format.

Gate: Unit 452/0/6 (+11), Integration 100/0, Simulation 127/0 byte-identical.

### P4.5.3 — ExitReplayer venue divergences — **Done**

**Commit:** `fix(P4.5.3): ExitReplayer venue divergences — 4 fixes + deferred validation gate foundation`

Four confirmed bugs fixed, all discovered by the static review and confirmed by direct code trace:

**(a) Short-side spread ignored.** `TradeExcursionInput.SpreadPips` was populated by the controller but
read by NOTHING. The venue detects short SL/TP on the ASK (bar shifted by full spread per P0.2 convention)
and fills short exits at ask. The replayer now adds `SpreadPips` to short-side bar extremes for both
detection AND fill. Every short exit (SL/TP/Trail/BE/EndOfData) gets `+spreadPips` on the exit price.

**(b) BE/trail cadence mismatch.** The replayer previously updated BE/trailing per PATH POINT (= M1 fine bar);
the real venue evaluates trailing/BE once per DECISION bar. Fix: bucket path points into decision-bar
groups. BE/trail is applied from the previous bar's accumulated extreme BEFORE the exit check for the new
bar — matching the venue's ordering (TrailEvaluator runs after bar N closes, before bar N+1's exit
evaluation). New `DecisionTfMinutes` param on `ExitRule` (default 60 → H1).

**(c) MAE output garbage.** `adverseExtreme` was computed as a positive number but compared with `<` against
a zero start — genuine adverse moves (+10) never recorded while favorable-side bars recorded as negative
noise. Flipped to `>`. Added MAE/MFE asserts to every replayer test (zero tests asserted these before).

**(d) Partial-TP unmodeled.** `tradeSize` was decremented and never entered R math. Until split-R accounting
exists, `Replay` throws `NotSupportedException` on rules with partial dimensions; `ExitGridEvaluator.Evaluate`
skips them silently rather than silently-wrong.

New/updated tests: 17 replayer tests rewritten for spread-adjusted exits + MAE assertions + cadence semantics.
2 partial-TP tests deleted (now throw). `ExitReplayerTests` went from 15 tests to 17 tests total.

Gate: Unit 453/0/6, Integration 100/0, Simulation 127/0 byte-identical.

### P4.5.1 — Walk-forward harness fixes — **Done**

**Commit:** `fix(P4.5.1): walk-forward test leg + pure PlateauPicker + Enqueue fail handling`

CRITICAL: `WalkForwardBackgroundService.ExecuteJobAsync` swept TRAIN then recorded the best train cell's
numbers AS `Test*` — the "stitched OOS equity curve" was stitched in-sample maxima. `PickPlateauCell`
was `MaxBy(NetProfit + WinRate×1000)` — an arbitrary mixed-unit scalar with no neighborhood logic
and no deterministic tiebreak.

Fixes:
1. **Missing test leg:** new `RunTestWindowAsync` runs ONE backtest over `[testFrom, testTo]` with the
   frozen best-cell params (60-day indicator warmup preload). Results stored in the existing `TestRunId`
   field + `TestNetProfit`/`TestTotalTrades`/`TestWinRatePct` columns.
2. **`PlateauPicker`** (`TradingEngine.Services/Helpers`): pure 3×3-neighborhood-median implementation.
   Ranks by median NetProfit, then median WinRate, then smaller param value (deterministic tiebreak).
   Accepts a minimal `PlateauCell` struct (zero Web deps).
3. **Enqueue fail handling:** `TryWrite` failure now marks the job "failed" instead of leaving it pending.
4. **PlateauValue** no longer mixes money and percent units.

New tests: 6 unit tests (`PlateauPickerTests`): empty, single, <3, plateau-vs-isolated-peak, tiebreak, errors-skipped.

Gate: Unit 459/0/6, Integration 100/0, Simulation 127/0 byte-identical.

### P4.5.4–P4.5.7 — **Not started — NEXT**

Remaining per PLAN.md §3 P4.5.4–.7 + cTrader test triage (see `docs/CTRADER-TEST-POLICY.md`):
- P4.5.4: Wire saved calibrations into run consumption (SL/TP consumed by nothing, no Mode=Calibrated)
- P4.5.5: Fix P(pass) surfaces (trades-as-days, mid-challenge framing on research surfaces)
- P4.5.6: Scoreboard fixes (in-sample vibes, symbol/TF filter, frequency formula ~30× off)
- P4.5.7: Smaller items (path cap, fetch-by-run, censoring, plateau highlighting)
- cTrader test triage: implement the policy (tag keep-set CtraderContract, retire behavior tests)

Execution order the next session should follow the remaining PLAN.md §3 P4.5 sequence: P4.5.4 → P4.5.5/.6 → P4.5.7.

## P4 — Research metrics — **Done** (2026-07-05, same session as P3 wrap-up)

**Commit:** `feat(P4): research metrics — P(pass) everywhere, walk-forward harness, scoreboard`
Includes 5 audit fixes riding along (A1–A4 exit-lab/PassProbEstimator bugs + R1 DailyPnLComputer extraction).

### P4.1 — P(pass) everywhere

**What shipped:**
- Fixed `PassProbabilityEstimator` to respect `DailyDdBase` (A4 — was always balance-based, now branches on `InitialBalance` vs `DailyStart`).
- Extracted `DailyPnLComputer` (`TradingEngine.Services.Helpers`) from `VariantScorer` (R1).
- New `PassProbabilityService` — fail-loud on missing run risk profile (no silent default fallback).
- `GET /api/runs/{runId}/pass-probability?daysRemaining=30` on RunsController + BacktestAnalyticsController.
- `ExitLabCellResponse` gained `PassProbability` computed from trade R-values via bootstrap (0.5% risk, Monte Carlo 2K runs against standard FTMO rules).
- Angular: P(pass) stat tile on run detail (probability, daily breach %, max breach %, projected equity, recommendation), P(pass) column on exit-lab results table (color-coded green/yellow/red).

### P4.2 — Walk-forward harness

**What shipped:**
- `WalkForwardBackgroundService` — `BackgroundService` with `Channel<WalkForwardJobEntity>` work queue (Bounded, Wait full-mode).
- `WalkForwardHub` (SignalR) — real-time `WindowCompleted` / `JobCompleted` / `JobFailed` push to `/hubs/walk-forward`.
- `WalkForwardController` — `POST /api/walk-forward/start`, `GET /api/walk-forward/jobs`, `GET /api/walk-forward/jobs/{jobId}`.
- `WalkForwardJobEntity` + `WalkForwardWindowResultEntity` + M38 EF migration.
- Extended `WalkForwardSpec` with sweep parameters (Strategies, Symbols, Timeframes, From, To, ParamGrid, Balance).
- Orchestration: per window, runs `SweepRunnerService` on train → plateau-picks best cell (`MaxBy` profit+winrate) → records chosen params + trials count.
- Angular `/walk-forward` page: config form (date range, folds, train fraction, balance, param grid), SignalR-connected progress bar + live window results, stitched OOS equity chart.

### P4.3 — Scoreboard

**What shipped:**
- `ScoreboardController` — `GET /api/scoreboard` (matrix strategy×symbol×TF from completed runs), `POST /api/scoreboard/{id}/park`, `POST /api/scoreboard/{id}/unpark`.
- `StrategyCellParkEntity` + M39 EF migration — per-cell parking with reason (unique index on strategy+symbol+timeframe).
- Angular `/scoreboard` page: filterable table (all/active/parked), per-cell avgR, trades/wk, traffic light (P4.4 frequency check), park modal with reason.
- Traffic light (P4.4): computes `neededTrades = -ln(0.05) / ln(1 - riskPerTrade * avgR)` vs actual trades/wk. Green: 4 weeks suffices; Yellow: 12 weeks; Red: cannot plausibly pass.

### Gate evidence
- Unit: 441 passed, 6 skipped, 0 failed.
- Integration: 100/100 passed.
- Fast Simulation: 127/127 passed (~9s, byte-identical).
- cTrader Pipeline E2E: 8/8 passed (4m2s).
- Full build: 0 errors.

### What's NOT in P4 (deferred to P5)
- `ReferenceScales` population from downloaded history (schema exists, needs P5 data).
- `ExitReplayer` partial-TP split logic.
- `MISSING_DATA` verdict implementation (still in P2's deferred verdict-funnel work).

### What's next for P5
- Download 7 symbols × 4 TFs (M1, M15, H1, H4) — owner-driven, agent supports.
- Non-FX correctness tests (XAUUSD, BTCUSD, US30 pip value + cost validation).
- Exploration triage: run all strategies × symbols × {M15, H1, H4} exploration runs over full history.
- Portfolio assembly: correlation groups, per-group open-risk caps, Monte Carlo P(pass).
